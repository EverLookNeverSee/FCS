! This program finds all numbers between 100 and 999 such that the
! number is equal to the sum of the cubes of the digits. For Example:
! 153 = (1 ** 3) + (5 ** 3) + (3 ** 3)

program number_cube
    implicit none
    ! defining integer variables
    integer :: number, d1, d2, d3, d_temp
end program number_cube
