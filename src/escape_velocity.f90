! This program calculates the escape velocity from earth.
! The escape velocity is defined as the minimum velocity
! that a projectile requires to escape from the earth.

program escape_velocity
    implicit none
    ! radius of earth in meter and mass of earth in kilogram
    real :: earth_radius = 6378.0e3, earth_mass = 5.98e24
    ! gravitational constant
    real :: G = 6.67300e-11
    real :: escape_velocity
end program escape_velocity
